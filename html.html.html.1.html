         HOW TO MAKE A CAKE

         A basic vanilla cake can be made by following a simple recipe. 
         Ingredients often include all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, softened unsalted butter,
          eggs, vanilla extract, and whole milk. 
Steps for making the cake involve preheating the oven and preparing the pan by greasing and flouring it.
 Dry ingredients are whisked together in a bowl. In a separate bowl, softened butter and sugar are beaten
  until fluffy. Eggs are added one at a time, followed by vanilla extract. The dry ingredients are then
   gradually added to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing until just combined and 
   avoiding overmixing. The batter is poured into the prepared pan and baked until a toothpick inserted
    into the center comes out clean. The cake should cool in the pan on a wire rack before being inverted
     onto the rack to cool completely. 
After cooling, the cake can be frosted or dusted with powdered sugar.

        HOW TO MAKE A VANILLA Cake

        Ingredients 

For the Cake:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 cups granulated sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
4 large eggs, room temperature
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
1 cup whole milk, room temperature 
For the Vanilla Buttercream Frosting:
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
4 cups powdered sugar, sifted
2 - 3 tablespoons milk (or heavy cream), as needed
2 teaspoons vanilla extract 

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Prep: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, then line the bottoms with parchment paper.
2. Combine Dry Ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt.
3. Combine Wet Ingredients: In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the softened butter until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla extract.
4. Mix Batter: Alternately add the dry ingredients mixture and the milk to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until just combined, being careful not to overmix.
5. Bake: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 28-32 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
6. Cool: Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then, turn them out onto wire racks to cool completely before frosting. 

Assembly and Frosting:

Make Frosting: In a large bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy. Gradually add the sifted powdered sugar and vanilla extract, mixing on low speed until combined, then increase speed to medium until fluffy. Add milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you reach your desired consistency.
Level (Optional): Once the cakes are completely cool, use a serrated knife to level the tops if they have domed.                                                                                                                                                                                        
Assemble: Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a generous layer of frosting on top. Place the second layer on top. Use the remaining frosting to cover the top and sides of the entire cake.
Decorate: Decorate with sprinkles, fruit, or enjoy as is!
